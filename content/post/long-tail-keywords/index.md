Everybody loves long tail keywords. Everybody needs some.

It is pure gold for young hopefuls.  Long tail keywords help get the foot in the SERP door and start climbing the ranking charts. Walk before you run. Long tails before going after the popular short tail (aka head) keywords.

For the veterans, long tail keywords are a way to divine user's need for new information and cater to their needs. A source of new ideas when you are stuck.


### What are long tail keywords?
Keyword is a phrase with one or more words that users enter into the google search box to find something they need. 

A head keyword is mostly a single word with very huge traffic but also very high competition. 

Long tail keywords are keywords with 3 or more words that have fewer users searching for. This may be because it is a niche topic or because the it is something that users look for once in a while. 

A mid-tail keyword falls between the long tail keywords and head keywords.

While a head keyword (also known as short tail keyword) have high traffic, the number of long tail keywords is huge in comparison. 

Most of the searches in google are for long tail keywords.

For example, 'keto diet' is a short-tail keyword. It has been searched 2.5M times globally and 1.83M times in US in the last month. On the other hand 'keto diet plan for beginners' have 35K and 27K searches respectively. 'keto diet plan for women' have 1.9K and 1.6K respectively. 'keto diet plan for women's weight loss' have just 50 searches globally.

### Why are long tail keywords important?
Long Tail Keywords are the bread and butter of SEO Experts and for good reason.

#### Understand User Intent
The intention and needs of the user are more easily understandable. Compare the long tail keyword '1200 calorie keto diet plan' to 'keto diet plan'. 
Here are a few things we can immediately infer.
* We now know users are looking for a specific calorie goal. 
* We also know their need is to lose weight (as opposed to managing a medical condition). 
* They are also probably working with a date or time period in mind. 
* They might also be on an exercise regimen or considering one. 
 
Now you can tailor the content for this keyword to this user's specific need. 

When the content is relatable, the user stays on your page longer. This is a very significant signal used by Google to boost your site's authority.

The user is also more likely to share your content.


#### Better target your users
When long tail users demonstrate user's intent, you can pick and choose whom to target. Consider if you are promoting an SEO tool. People who search for 'SEO tools for beginners' or 'free SEO Tools' may not be your ideal targets as you are not yet ready to pay for a tool. On the other hand, someone searching for 'SEO tools for competitor analysis' may be ready as they have identified their competitors and may have an active business.

#### Faster Way to SERP top
When you fight your way with all the big players in the field for the top short-tail keywords, you a very little fish in a big pond. When you pick a long-tail keyword with lesser competition, you become bigger fish in a small pond. You can get a taste of success much earlier. As your site's visibility grows in Google, you can slowly chip your way to the short-tail keywords and big game.

#### Plan the blog strategy
The long tail keywords identify more niche interests, queries and doubts within a broader category. It can help you form a detailed long-term plan of how to address the needs of that particular segment.

#### Reach the coveted Position 0
Long tail keywords are often user queries. When you correctly address the query and do the technical SEO properly (like structured data) you can easily outrank established players and reach the top spot - Rich Snippet or Featured Snippet. Nothing increases user's confidence in your site like seeing Google trust you.


### Long Tail Keyword FAQ

There are quite a lot of questions related to Long Tail Keyword and we would like to address some of them. If there is something other question you like to see addressed in this section, please leave a comment and we will be glad to address it.

#### 1. What is an LSI Keyword? How are they related to Long Tail Keywords?
LSI refers to Latent Symantic Indexing. It is a technique that Google and other search engines use to understand a webpage. 
* The text in a webpage is split into words. Words that go together often are kept as phrases. 
* Each topic has a set of phrases that occur often in that context. These are the LSI keywords for that topic. 
* If you write a blog on that topic, Google checks to see if you are using atleast some of the LSI keywords. 
* This signals to Google that you are writing meaningful content and not just stuffing a single keyword.

For example, if you take the concept of 'keto diet', some LSI keywords would be 'low-carb', 'high-fat', 'grass-fed beef', 'MCT oil', 'research', 'weight', 'carb intake'.

As a software engineer myself, I am familiar with the algorithm and it pains to see how most SEO gurus and all LSI keyword generators tout long tail keywords as LSI keywords.

LSI keywords are not the same as long tail keywords though there will be some overlap. 

Long tail keywords are exact words that users enter in the search box. 

On the other hand, LSI keyword is more like the lingo that a community uses to discuss it's special interests. Google checks your blogpost against this lingo to determine if you have really made content useful for that group or just pretending to be.

If you are interested in a true LSI keyword generator, please let me know in the comments. I am quite interested in building one if people have a need for it.


#### 2. What is keyword cannibalization? Does targeting Long Tail Keywords result in keyword Cannibalization?
Keyword Cannibalization is when multiple pages on your website target the same keyword. So they end up as competing against each other for ranking. This is not a problem for Long Tail Keywords if the keyword targeted on each page are not too similar. 

For example, 'keto diet for women' and '1200 calorie keto diet plan' are sufficiently different to not cannibalize each other as the intent of the queries are very different, though they are both about 'keto diet'.

#### 3. What is keyword volume or keyword search volume?
Keyword Search Volume is the number of times a particular keyword has been searched for in a search engine during the given time period. 

In most tools, this is usually one month. So 'keto diet plan for women' of search volume 1.9K  means 1900 people have searched for the keyword 'keto diet plan for women' in the last month on Google.

#### 4. What is keyword difficulty?
Keyword difficulty is a measure for conveying how difficult it is to rank for a particular keyword. 

This measure is designed and calculated independently by several SEO tools. 

So, the difficulty value for a keyword may differ from one tool to another. 

Generally, the values are on the scale of 0-100 and lesser the value the easier it is to rank.  For example, Moz's Keyword difficulty ranking is on algorithmic scale. So a value of 20-30 is much easier to rank compared to a keyword with value 30-40.

In the image below, SEO difficulty implies difficulty in ranking organically. Paid difficulty refers to difficulty in placing ads in Google Adwords.

#### 5. What are the different types of long tail keywords?
There are generally 5 types of keywords that the user is looking for with varying conversion rates.
* Navigational Keywords/Brand keywords - when the user is trying to reach a specific page they already know. Very Low Conversion rate
* Informational keywords - when the user is looking for a specific piece of information. Low Conversion rate
* Research keywords - when the user is trying to understand a product or service and is looking into options. High conversion rate
* Buyer-Intent keywords- when the user is ready to buy, credit card out. Very High conversion rate
* Local search keywords - when the user is looking for products or services in their immediate environment - High Conversion rate.

If you are a blog, informational and research keywords would work very well. On the other hand, if you are an eCommerce website, Buyer-Intent keyword shows that the user is much further on the Sales Cycle and ripe to convert.

Local businesses can do their very best if they focus on local search long-tail keywords.

#### 6. How do you use long tail keywords?

* Long tail keywords can be used as individual topics on which to write indepth well-research articles to pull in Search ranking and pageviews. 
* They can also be used as supporting terms for an article on the main concept to increase keyword density naturally.
* They can be used as pointers to target featured snippets and voice search. Long tail keywords that sound more like natural language are ideal for this. Coupling such long tail keywords with simple, short answers is a good strategy to reach the featured snippet.
* Use it as a signal for understanding buyer intent and filter out users at the lower end of the sales cycle. This is especially profitable for Google Ads and Local Search, where you only target users with a high intent to buy and thus increase the ROI drastically.
* Long tail keywords help keep you on the right path, ensuring you produce content that will add value to the users and is understandable for a search engine.

For example, I have great itching to name this article "Long Tail Keywords: Gonna catch`em all". While that would be a fun title for my personal blog, it would not do well for the search engine as it does not clearly convey the intent of the post. This is crucial for blogs that live and die by clicks.
