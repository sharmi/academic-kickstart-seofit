Long tail keywords are an effective strategy for new blogs and established ones alike.

If you just starting out, using a paid tool may not be ideal and you would be looking for a free tool to find long tail keywords to help validate your idea.

Many tools that were free like "Keywords Everywhere" are paid tools now. Even tools that had limited free tier have become totally paid. Yet, new tools are coming up every month to fill the void.  Here are some tools that I use often. I have made short demos so you can see what they do in a glance.


#### [KeywordShitter](https://keywordshitter.com/)
One new tool I found recently and totally loved was KeywordShitter. I found the name initially off-putting but the tool really delivers. I have managed to download about 285 long tail keywords for the keyword "long tail keyword"

You can also specify words that have to be present using "positive filter" and words that should not be present using "negative filter".

Once you have enough terms, you can download the list as text file by clicking on the "download" link.

#### [Keywordtool.io](keywordtool.io)

Keywordtool.io is another great tool.  You also get to find keywords specific to Google Search, Youtube, Amazon, Bing etc and it is possible to get country specific keywords for each of these. How great is that!

Let us feed the same keyword "Long tail keyword" to keywordtool.io and see the results.

While the free version does not give the keyword's search volume, the paid version does and the paid version also gives twice the number of keywords as the free version does.

#### [keyword.io](keyword.io)
keyword.io is another great tool to get long tail keywords. The free version gives you plenty of long tail keywords. If you sign up for the free account, you can download them as a text or csv file. If you sign up for a paid account, then you will get the search volumes too.

#### [Keyword Surfer]()
Keyword surfer is free Chrome Extension. Once installed in Chrome, whenever you do a search on google, you get the search volume for the current keyword and more keyword suggestions.

#### Google Search
Google Search itself is a great tool for getting great keyword suggestions. Of course, one needs to put in a lot of work to get a sizeable amount of keywords but considering that the keywords are straight from the horse's mouth, it should never be overlooked. Every content creator should look out for the 3 great features of a google search page.

1. keyword suggestions dropbox
  Google suggests a list of possible keywords when you type a query into the search box. These the keywords that people search for the most. So google tries to help the next user by giving some useful suggestions. This can be a veritable goldmine.

2. People Also Ask Box
  The people also ask box comes up with plenty of real questions that users search for. Try different but related search queries and collect all the questions that come up.  This can be extremely useful in crafting a well designed blogpost.

3. Searches related to
  At the bottom of the search page, google gives a list of other related search queries. This can be added to your list of long tail keywords. Also visit these pages and collect other keyword suggestions and People Questions on those pages too.

#### TODO add that tool with search volume
#### Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool
No list of tools is complete without the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool.

The first thing you could do is give a topic and get lot more keyword suggestions with the search volume range. Google Keywords Planner used to provide exact search counts but that has changed over the years and now we get only ranges like 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10000 etc.  While this is not as great as it used to be, it is still something.  The number of topics or seed keywords you can give at one time is restricted to 10.

The second thing you could do is submit a list of keywords to Google Keyword Planner Tool and get the search volume range for all your keywords.


#### Google Search Console
Apart from Google's own services, the rest of the tools all derive from the same data source. The data source boosts of 500 million datapoints. That sounds really big right?

But think of the number of people in the world. 7 Billion.

The number of people in the world who use the internet. [4.5 Billion](https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm)

Everyday an average person searches on Google 3 or 4 times in a day

As per sources from [Google Zeitgeist](https://archive.google.com/zeitgeist/2012/#the-world) and [Internet Live Stats](https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/) around 1.2 trillion searches are done every year.


500 million datapoints are small potatoes. Of course, they can be used to guess at what your competitors are upto, are they progressing and where.

But if you want to expand your strategy and uncover real long tails, new opportunities, there is another place that you can look at.

Google Search Console.

Google Search Console's dashboard might not be the most versatile but Google allows you to download all the keywords. You can also choose the time period for the data : Last week, Last month, 3 months or a custom period.

One way to check for keywords you can target :

1. Filter for keywords that are ranking for position 7 or higher. These are potentially keywords you can rank for better if the content on the page is improved
2. Find all the keywords that you are ranking for this month that you did not rank for the previous month.  These are new keywords that Google has decided are good match for your website. You would have intentionally targeted some of the keywords. Usually there will be a sizeable number of keywords that you have not targeted but Google still sends traffic your way. This may be because keyword is a great match for your site or because the keyword was a new concept and the content targeted to this keyword is yet to be created. Either way, you can capitalize on Google's decision and create content for such keywords.  You can rank faster for these keywords as Google already considers you an appropriate source. Of course, you will need to choose which keywords to consider from the bigger list of keywords.
