Everybody loves Long Tail Keywords. Everybody needs long Tail Keywords. From _____ of Problogger to the young hopeful, who started the blog yesterday.

It is pure gold for young hopefuls.  Long tail keywords help get our foot in the door and start climbing the ranking charts. Walk before you run. Long tails before going after the popular short tail keywords.

For the veterans, long tail keywords are a way to divine user's need for new information and cater to their needs. A source of new ideas when you are stuck.

### When is a good time start with long tail keywords?

It would be easier to get ideas when you have a running website for a while which will help understand the user needs and see which of the long tail keywords you already cater to.


### What are long tail keywords?
Keyword is a phrase with one or more words that users enter into the google search box to find something they need. Long tail keywords are keywords with 3 or more words that have fewer users searching for. This may be because it is a niche topic or because the it is something that users look for once in a while. For example, 'keto diet' is a short-tail keyword. It has been searched 2.5M times globally and 1.83M times in US in the last month. On the other hand 'keto diet plan for beginners' have 35K and 27K searches respectively. 'keto diet plan for women' have 1.9K and 1.6K respectively. 'keto diet plan for women's weight loss' have just 50 searches globally.

If you look closer at the results, you will see that there are a lot of blog posts tuned for 'keto diet plan for beginners'. The search page is dominated by 'Featured snippet' and Ads.

On the other hand, the search results page for 'keto diet plan for women' do not have any blog posts tuned for the keyword. Yet, there are more than a thousand searches and Ads displayed to prove that there is a demand for content. Now contructing an SEO-optimized great content for this title will easily establish you as an authority in the eyes of Google Search Ranking Algorithm and easily climb onto the front page of the SERP. With a little more crafting, you can also easily capture the 'Position 0' also known as 'Rich Snippets'.

### Why are long tail keywords important?
Long Tail Keywords are bread and butter of SEO Experts and for good reason.

#### Understand User Intent
The intention and needs of the user are more easily understandable. Consider '1200 calorie keto diet plan' to 'keto diet plan'. We now know users are looking for a specific calorie goal. We also know their need is to lose weight (as opposed to managing a medical condition). They are also probably working with a date or time period in mind. They might also be on an exercise regimen or considering one. So you can tailor content to this user's need. 

When the content is relatable, the user stays on your page longer. This is a very significant signal used by Google to boost your site's authority.

The user is also more likely to share your content.


#### Better target your users
When long tail users demonstrate user's intent, you can pick and choose whom to target. Consider if you are promoting an SEO tool. People who search for 'SEO tools for beginners' or 'free SEO Tools' may not be your ideal targets as you are not yet ready to pay for a tool. On the other hand, someone searching for 'SEO tools for competitor analysis' may be ready as they have identified their competitors and may have an active business.

#### Faster Way to SERP top
When you fight your way with all the big players in the field for the top short-tail keywords, you a very little fish in a big pond. When you pick a long-tail keyword with lesser competition, you become bigger fish in a small pond. You can get a taste of success much earlier. As your site's visibility grows in Google, you can slowly chip your way to the short-tail keywords and big game.

#### Plan the blog strategy
The long tail keywords identify more niche interests, queries and doubts within a broader category. It can help you form a detailed long-term plan of how to address the needs of that particular segment.

#### Reach the coveted Position 0
Long tail keywords are often user queries. When you correctly address the query and do the technical SEO properly (like structured data) you can easily outrank established players and reach the top spot - Rich Snippet or Featured Snippet. Nothing increases user's confidence in your site like seeing Google trust you.

### Long Tail Keyword Finders in 2020
Many tools that were free like "Keywords Everywhere" are paid tools now. Even tools that had limited free tier have become totally paid. Yet, new tools are coming up every month to fill the void.  Here are some tools that I use often. I have made short demos so you can see what they do in a glance.

#### [KeywordShitter](https://keywordshitter.com/)
One new tool I found recently and totally loved was KeywordShitter. I found the name initially off-putting but the tool really delivers. I have managed to download about 285 long tail keywords for the keyword "long tail keyword"

You can also specify words that have to be present using "positive filter" and words that should not be present using "negative filter".

Once you have enough terms, you can download the list as text file by clicking on the "download" link.

#### [Keywordtool.io](keywordtool.io)

Keywordtool.io is another great tool.  You also get to find keywords specific to Google Search, Youtube, Amazon, Bing etc and it is possible to get country specific keywords for each of these. How great is that!

Let us feed the same keyword "Long tail keyword" to keywordtool.io and see the results.

While the free version does not give the keyword's search volume, the paid version does and the paid version also gives twice the number of keywords as the free version does.

#### [keyword.io](keyword.io)
keyword.io is another great tool to get long tail keywords. The free version gives you plenty of long tail keywords. If you sign up for the free account, you can download them as a text or csv file. If you sign up for a paid account, then you will get the search volumes too.

#### Google Search
Google Search itself is a great tool for getting great keyword suggestions. Of course, one needs to put in a lot of work to get a sizeable amount of keywords but considering that the keywords are straight from the horse's mouth, it should never be overlooked. Every content creator should look out for the 3 great features of a google search page.

1. keyword suggestions dropbox
  Google suggests a list of possible keywords when you type a query into the search box. These the keywords that people search for the most. So google tries to help the next user by giving some useful suggestions. This can be a veritable goldmine.

  {{< figure src="google_search_keyword_suggestions.png" title="A caption" lightbox="true" >}}

2. People Also Ask Box
  The people also ask box comes up with plenty of real questions that users search for. Try different but related search queries and collect all the questions that come up.  This can be extremely useful in crafting a well designed blogpost.

  {{< figure src="google_search_people_also_ask.png" title="A caption" lightbox="true" >}}

3. Searches related to
  At the bottom of the search page, google gives a list of other related search queries. This can be added to your list of long tail keywords. Also visit these pages and collect other keyword suggestions and People Questions on those pages too.

#### TODO add that tool with search volume
#### Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool
No list of tools is complete without the Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool.

The first thing you could do is give a topic and get lot more keyword suggestions with the search volume range. Google Keywords Planner used to provide exact search counts but that has changed over the years and now we get only ranges like 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10000 etc.  While this is not as great as it used to be, it is still something.  The number of topics or seed keywords you can give at one time is restricted to 10.

The second thing you could do is submit a list of keywords to Google Keyword Planner Tool and get the search volume range for all your keywords.


#### Google Search Console
Apart from Google's own services, the rest of the tools all derive from the same data source. The data source boosts of 500 million datapoints. That sounds really big right?

But think of the number of people in the world. 7 Billion.

The number of people in the world who use the internet. [4.5 Billion](https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm)

Everyday an average person searches on Google 3 or 4 times in a day

As per sources from [Google Zeitgeist](https://archive.google.com/zeitgeist/2012/#the-world) and [Internet Live Stats](https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/) around 1.2 trillion searches are done every year.


500 million datapoints are small potatoes. Of course, they can be used to guess at what your competitors are upto, are they progressing and where.

But if you want to expand your strategy and uncover real long tails, new opportunities, there is another place that you can look at.

Google Search Console.

Google Search Console's dashboard might not be the most versatile but Google allows you to download all the keywords. You can also choose the time period for the data : Last week, Last month, 3 months or a custom period.

One way to check for keywords you can target :

1. Filter for keywords that are ranking for position 7 or higher. These are potentially keywords you can rank for better if the content on the page is improved
2. Find all the keywords that you are ranking for this month that you did not rank for the previous month.  These are new keywords that Google has decided are good match for your website. You would have intentionally targeted some of the keywords. Usually there will be a sizeable number of keywords that you have not targeted but Google still sends traffic your way. This may be because keyword is a great match for your site or because the keyword was a new concept and the content targeted to this keyword is yet to be created. Either way, you can capitalize on Google's decision and create content for such keywords.  You can rank faster for these keywords as Google already considers you an appropriate source. Of course, you will need to choose which keywords to consider from the bigger list of keywords.




The next thing

So here I am, researching on doing a blogpost on Long Tail Keywords. Of course, I have so much to say that I dunno where to start. Since I am going to write this post for my dear users, why not head out and understand what they want first?


For example, I have great itching to name this articile "Long Tail Keywords: Gonna catch`em all". While that would be a fun title for my personal blog, it would not do on the Search Engine Field where we live and die by clicks.
